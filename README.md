This project is a Pokémon listing application where users can browse a collection of Pokémon. When clicking on a Pokémon card, a modal appears displaying detailed information, including a larger image, stats, abilities, and all evolutionary forms. The application also allows users to search for Pokémon by name or ID.
Next.js was chosen as the main framework due to its easy integration with great libs and its performance optimizations. For authentication, cookies are used to securely store login information, ensuring session persistence while maintaining security. A server-side middleware verifies the user's authentication status whenever they open the application, persisting the session even after closing the browser or tab.
The login form is built with react-hook-form, reducing unnecessary re-renders, and yup for validation
To handle data caching,react-query was implemented, persisting API data previously fetched data and reducing redundant requests.
For testing, Playwright was used to perform both end-to-end (E2E) and component tests
